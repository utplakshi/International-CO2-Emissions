# International-CO2-Emissions
This is a repository for my Data Visualization project. I have used R, Tableau and Jupyter Notebook for this particular projects. Some of the inferences I could conclude by given database was that Population plays a major role in increasing CO2 Emissions.

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis for the chosen dataset, wherein, many of the basic questions have been answered regarding countries and the type of greenhouse gases emitted.

Have also performed numerous data visualisations to present the inferences in a more presentable and clear way.

Implemented machine learning models, namely, kNN, PCA and Linear Regression.

Included two other algorithms as a part of novelity in the project, namely, Bar Joseph's Seration Algorithm and Bertin's Permutation Matrix.
